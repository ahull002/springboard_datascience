    "In this overview, I will venture into the domain-specific Structured Query Language (SQL) utilized in programming and designed for managing data residing in relational database management systems (RDBMS), or even for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Query Language, or is commonly called SQL (pronounced \"ess-que-el\"), is a domain-specific programming language. SQL utilized for communicating with relational database management systems (RDMS). According to the ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for RDMS. SQL statements are used to carry out tasks such as revise data in a database or retrieve data information from a database. Traditional RDMS that make use of SQL are Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, and Ingres. Although nearly all database systems use SQL, most of them also have their additional exclusive extensions that are usually only used on their respective networks. SQL commands such as \"Select,\" “From,” \"Insert,\" \"Update,\" \"Delete,\" \"Create,\" “Group,” “Order,” and \"Drop\" can be employed to accomplish almost everything that someone needs to do in a database. This overview utilizes SQL to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on simulated data from a Country Club that mimics a real-world example of what Data Scientists will face in the workforce when confronted with various data sets or databases. The prepatory steps taken in this exercise was in downloading a standalone Microsoft (MS) SQL Server (2019); downloading the MS SQL Server Management Studio to interface with my standalone database, extracting flat files: Comma-Separate Values (CSV) from Springboard's SQL database; then transforming, wrangling, and analyzing the data both in Python and SQL while posting the SQL queries and Python script to this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The basic structure of the relational dabases is as follows:__\n",
    "\n",
    "> i.\tA relational database consists of a collection of tables, each having a unique name.\n",
    ">       A row/observation/record in a table represents a relationship among a set of values.\n",
    ">       Thus a table represents a collection of relationships/observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ii.\tThere is an exact correspondence between the concept of a table and the mathematical concept of a relation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During the following example, I will demonstrate how to use Data-Wrangling techniques in Jupyter Lab on three .sql files which are have been converted to .csv: __*Bookings, Facilities, and Members*__. Additionally, I will answer ten questions (set objectives) that emulate a real-world example of what a Data Scientist may encounter in an organization attempting to gain insight from a SQL file types!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Set objectives:__\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1.\tSome of the facilities charge a fee to members, but some do not. Please list the names of the facilities that do.\n",
    "> 2.\tHow many facilities do not charge a fee to members?\n",
    "> 3.\tProduce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, where the price is less than 20% of the facility's monthly maintenance cost? Return the facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities.\n",
    "> 4.    Retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Write the query without using the OR operator.\n",
    "> 5.    Produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as 'cheap' or 'expensive', depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is more than 100 dollars? Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities\n",
    "in question.\n",
    "> 6.    Get the first and last name of the last member(s) who signed up. Do not use the LIMIT clause for your solution.\n",
    "> 7.    Produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court? Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by the member name.\n",
    "> 8.    Produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than 30 dollars? Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user's ID is always 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost. Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries.\n",
    "> 9.    Produce the same result as in Q8 but using a subquery.\n",
    "> 10.   Produce a list of facilities with a total revenue of less than 1000. The output of facility name and total revenue, sorted by revenue. Remember that there's a different cost for guests and members!\n",

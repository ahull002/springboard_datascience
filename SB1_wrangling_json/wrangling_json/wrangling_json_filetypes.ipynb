    "\n",
    "In this overview, I will venture into the lightweight data-interchange format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is effortless for humans to read and write while also being accessible for machines to parse from and generate. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format working between clients, servers, and embedded in programming languages. It is a subset of the JavaScript object and distinct from any other programming language. JSON is a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard: ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. It has a text format that is completely language independent but utilizes analogs that are accustomed to programmers of the “C- family” of languages: C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others$^1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "JSON’s human-readable data structures are efficient for more extensive data exports that contain a hierarchically structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The basic structure of the JSON object is as follows:__\n",
    "\n",
    "> i.\tData is by name/value pairs with colons.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ii.\tCommas split data-objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> iii.\tCurly braces {} hold Data-Objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> iv.\tSquare brackets [] can be utilized to indicate a list of objects in a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "> v.\tData-Element enclosed with quotes for characters, and without quotes for a numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the following example, I will demonstrate how to use Data-Wrangling techniques on a __*World Bank JSON file*__. Additionally, I will answer three questions (set objectives) that emulate a real-world example of what a Data Scientist may encounter in an organization attempting to gain insight from a JSON file!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Set objectives:__\n",
    "1.\tWhat are the top 10 countries with the most projects?\n",
    "2.\tWhat are the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode') you see in the data?\n",
    "3.\tFinally, create a DataFrame with the missing names filled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Initial assessment of resources and tools:__\n",
    "1.\t__Resourse:__ Data Scientist, Alfred Hull\n",
    "2.  __Resourse:__ The data in this overview was provided at the World Bank and is 2.8 Megabytes (MB). The data contains a 500 by 50 matrix: five hundred (500) rows by fifty (50) fields.\n",
    "3.  __Tool:__ The computing resources used for this example were the MS Surface Book 2 for Business - 15\" Display /256 GB / Intel Core i7. High-speed Intel processors, (quad-core available),NVIDIA GeForce GTX graphics, 17 hours of battery life, and running Windows 10 Pro.\n",
    "4.  __Tool:__ The software used for this examples was Windows 10, Anaconda, IPython, and Jupyter Notebook\n",
